# Can an AI break the L[1/3] barrier in integer factoring?

We pointed an autonomous AI agent at one of the deepest open problems in computational mathematics: **can integer factoring be done faster than L[1/3]?** The Number Field Sieve has been the state of the art since 1993 — over 30 years with no improvement to the exponent. We let an AI systematically explore whether a better approach exists.

**The result: 530 approaches investigated, every plausible mathematical avenue explored, no breakthrough found.** But the map of the territory is arguably the most comprehensive survey of factoring approaches ever compiled — and the structural insights about *why* L[1/3] is so hard are genuinely new.

## What the agent discovered

After ~27 hours of autonomous research across smoothness-based methods, group-order algorithms, algebraic geometry, lattice methods, cohomological invariants, dynamical systems, information theory, and 20+ other mathematical areas:

**Five structural barriers** explain why every approach fails:
1. **L[1/3] wall** — any sieve with k parameters achieves L[1/(k+1)]; NFS has k=2
2. **Archimedean/non-archimedean gap** — integer size can't be iteratively reduced like polynomial degree
3. **GF(2) bottleneck** — each smooth relation yields exactly 1 bit; proved tight via universality of order-2 elements
4. **CRT opacity** — every computable invariant of Z/NZ either decomposes via CRT or costs as much as factoring
5. **Z-rigidity** — Z has no non-trivial ring endomorphism, which is why Frobenius descent (the key to function field breakthroughs) can't work over the integers

These form a **causal chain**: Z is rigid (#5) -> CRT is opaque (#4) -> search is binarized (#3) -> no metric shortcut (#2) -> L[1/3] wall (#1).

**The key meta-theorem** (informal): any algorithm using (i) algebraic structures over Z/NZ, (ii) smooth number detection, and (iii) GF(2) linear algebra achieves at best L[1/3]. Breaking through requires violating at least one of these three conditions.

**Probability estimate**: P(classical algorithm ever beats L[1/3]) ~ 2-3%.

## How it works

A master agent (Claude Code) reads `program.md` for its research directive, `expert.md` for accumulated knowledge, and `docs/` for formal barrier analysis. It then spawns 5 concurrent investigator subprocesses, each exploring a specific mathematical question. When an investigator finishes, the master harvests its findings into `expert.md` and launches a replacement. This runs continuously.

## Selected highlights from 530 investigations

- **Shor = the perfectoid tilt**: Shor's quantum algorithm is precisely "efficient computation of the perfectoid tilt" — quantum parallelism evaluates O(N) Frobenius iterates in O(log N) time. This is the cleanest known explanation of the quantum advantage for factoring.

- **Third channel systematically closed**: All 5 candidates for a third NFS smoothness source (second number field, p-adic, function field, adelic, modular forms) are either circular or reduce to MNFS constant improvements. Z provably cannot support a third independent smoothness channel.

- **The cohomological trichotomy**: Every cohomological invariant of Z/NZ falls into exactly one of three categories: (1) computable but CRT-decomposed, (2) encodes factoring but costs >= factoring, or (3) circular. No sweet spot exists.

- **1-bit-per-relation is a theorem**: Proved tight within congruence-of-squares via universality of order-2 elements. GF(k) for any k > 2 is strictly worse.

- **Tower descent axiomatics**: Precisely characterized the 4 requirements for FFS-style descent over Z — all impossible. The deep reason: in function fields, "degree" and "complexity" are independent parameters; in number fields they are the same.

## Known limitations

- **Session length**: The master wraps up after a few hours despite "never stop" instructions.
- **Orphan processes**: Investigator child processes can survive timeouts. Requires manual cleanup.
- **Diminishing returns**: After ~10 batches, the master enters grinding mode — mechanically launching variations rather than thinking strategically.
- **Local minimum**: Investigators' first instinct is to build a quadratic sieve. The master kills them when caught, but it wastes slots.
- **expert.md bloat**: The master appends without deduplicating. Requires periodic manual cleanup.
